          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is John and welcome to my website! Here will be some more information about myself. I enjoy partaking in many hobbies, mainly I enjoy computers and technology, playing the violin, and PC gaming. I also enjoy writing articles about the newest in technology, reading sci-fi and other book genres, listening to orchestral and baroque music, playing with my dog, and of course watching my favorite TV shows like Doctor Who and Parks and Recreation. Additionally, I participate in a couple clubs at school. Some of the clubs I am in are the engineering club, chamber orchestra, latin club, and ski club.</p>
          <p>I have been fascinated by technology ever since I was young and have always tried to understand the world around me. This helped me to grow my passion for computers and technology as I always wanted to learn more. I enjoy learning by watching youtube videos and reading articles on my own time as well as taking more science, and technology related courses through my school's STEM academy. My obsession with computers has led me to attend events for people with similar interests as mine like world Maker Faire, which was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. I also started my own business where I would fix people's electronics, for example, a big part of what I did was iPhones screen repairs. I as well got into building computers for myself and friends (specifications listed down below) which has really sparked my interest in pc gaming, and has led me to learn countless new things and meet new friends. Even this website, which has been programmed from scratch by myself! I am really hoping that my passion for PC gaming and technology will bring me to a nice college and a career in electrical engineering where I can designing computer systems, computer hardware, or computer gaming peripherals.</p>
          <p>But I am not only a technology enthusiast, I also enjoy taking part in the arts, especially performing arts. I have been playing the violin since I was in 4th grade in 2010. I have grown to become very serious about improving my musical skills by taking private lessons and dedicating many hours a week into practicing. I have had many great experiences playing the violin. Being among one of the more talented musicians I have been able to join more difficult orchestraâ€™s outside of school and play with more advanced groups of students, among these groups is our schools pit orchestra for numerous productions. In these pits I played with professional players and got to learn how to play the same music they play in the professional productions of these shows. Playing in a pit can be difficult for me, but is always very rewarding. Besides playing the violin, I additionally enjoyed writing technology oriented articles for my middle school's school newspaper where I also compiled all of the articles and put them into the final paper that would be printed. I plan to continue with this in highschool and hope to be a tech journalist when I am older. I furthermore enjoy graphic design. I have been teaching myself how to use a great photoshop alternative called paint.net, which I have made several graphics including the banner above.</p>
